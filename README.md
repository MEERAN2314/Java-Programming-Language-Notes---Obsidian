A structured collection of my Java programming notes as I progress through my learning journey.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as my digital knowledge base for Java programming concepts. I'm systematically organizing my notes here as I study from:

- [Bro Code's Java Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTtL8E4LzTQ) (primary resource)
- Supplementary articles and documentation
- Practical coding experiences

## üìù Notes Structure

All notes are:
- Created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) markdown format
- Organized by learning progression
- Continuously updated as I master new concepts
- Supplemented with code examples where applicable
