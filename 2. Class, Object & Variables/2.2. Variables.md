a reusable container for a value. Variable behaves as if it was the value it contains.  
  
  A variable is like a container that holds information (data) in your program. It has:  
    - A name (so you can refer to it)  
    - A type (what kind of data it holds)  
    - A value (the actual data)  
## **Two main types of variables:**  

###### 1. **Primitive** = Simple value stored directly in memory (stack)  
    These are basic building blocks that store simple values directly.  
    
    Examples:  
    int age = 25;               // Stores whole numbers    
    double price = 19.99;       // Stores decimal numbers    
    char grade = 'A';           // Stores single characters    
    boolean isJavaFun = true;   // Stores true/false  
    
    Key Points:  
    - Store the actual value directly  
    - Fixed size (int is always 32 bits, etc.)  
    - Fast to access  
    - 8 primitive types in Java: 
    -byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean  
    
###### 2. **Reference** = Memory addresss (stack) that points to the heap (heap)  
    These store "references" (like addresses) to objects rather than the objects themselves.  
    
    Examples:  
    String name = "Alice";      // String is an object    
    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};  // Array is an object    
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // Scanner is an object  
    
    Key Points:  
    - Store a reference (memory address) to an object  
    - The actual object lives somewhere else in memory  
    - Can be assigned null (meaning "no object")  
    - All non-primitive types are reference types  

### Steps to creating a variable:  
1. Declaration   
2. Assignment

## CODE:

int age = 25;               // Stores whole numbers  
double price = 19.99;       // Stores decimal numbers  
char grade = 'A';           // Stores single characters  
boolean isJavaFun = true;   // Stores true/false  
  
System.out.println("My age is: " + age);  // use "Sout" to automatically create the print statement  
System.out.println("The price of this cake is: " + price);  
System.out.println("My grade in math: " + grade);  
  
  
//boolean is mostly used in if statements  
// if the condition is not set in the "()" it automatically declare as true  
if (isJavaFun){  
    System.out.println("Java is really fun");  
}  
else {  
    System.out.println("You have skill issues");  
}  
  
String name = "Meeran";  
String food = "Pizza";  
String email = "meeranprofessional23@gmail.com";  
String car = "Mustang";  
String color = "red";  
  
boolean isAvalilabe = true;  
  
System.out.println("My name is " + name);  
System.out.println("My go to food is " + food);  
System.out.println("contact me by " + email);  
System.out.println("I would like to buy a " + car + " of colour " + color );  
  
if (isAvalilabe){  
    System.out.println(car + " is available in colour " + color);  
}  
else{  
    System.out.println(car + " is not available ");  
}
